# Local AET instance with docker swarm
This directory contains configuration that enables setting up local AET instance using single-node swarm cluster. 
Note that this is *not production recommended setup*.

AET stack defined in this example runs:
- MongoDB container with mounted volume (for persistency)
- Selenium Grid with Hub and 3 Nodes (2 Chrome instances each, totally 6 browsers)
- AET ActiveMq container
- AET Browsermob container
- AET Apache Karaf container with AET core installed (Runner, Workers, Web-API, Datastorage, Executor)
- AET Apache Server container with AET Report and [AET suite generator](https://github.com/m-suchorski/suite-generator/tree/feature/suite)
